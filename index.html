         <h3 class="post-title"><strong>MMASS</strong></h3>
         <div class="post-content">
           <p>I spent this week at <a href="http://www.mmass.info/">Music
             Analysis Summer School</a>. Liz Jigalin,
             Jasmin Leung and I held a forum at the end of the week to discuss
             compositional issues with the many talented composers, musicians and analysts attending. 
            Here's a paragraph I wrote on the question I posed to the group.
           <br> <br>
           Posing the question ‘How do you communicate your sonic desires?’ to this room of diverse musical minds, 
            the conversation turned to notation. This topic made quite evident the different approaches composers 
            have to control over their music. Most seemed to use standard forms of notation, notes on paper with 
            perhaps some graphics or text, handed out to musicians. We didn’t delve too much into the transfer of 
            ideas from the score to realisation by musicians, but focused more on how our ‘sonic desires’ move from 
            our heads to the page. Many in the room agreed that what’s harder than communicating desires is asking 
            oneself, “What do I want in the first place?” Through the conversation, we found that it’s unavoidable 
            for notation to become part of the compositional process. Before any sort of sketching of ideas, a 
            realm of possibilities exist, and it’s only by putting pen to paper that we start to narrow down these 
            options. As one young composer pointed out, this requires giving up your dreams of creating your 
            ‘musical masterpiece’, as going from the initial idea state to something more concrete immediately 
            opens your work up to limitations. The best advice I heard, though, was to be conscious of how much 
            control you actually want over your music. The music of Julio Estrada, who we studied earlier in the week 
            in a lecture by Pedro Alvarez, used to be portrayed through heavily detailed scores. In recent years, he’s 
            communicated his music through talking directly to performers, abandoning traditional forms of notation 
            entirely. What we finished the conversation on this topic with was a bold statement - that choices of 
            notation are political. Composers need to be aware of the implications of their notation and make a stance.
