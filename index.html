            I had an incredible time on the weekend with the music box project, who premiered
            my piece <i>Shallow Listening</i> at the Bendigo International Festival of
            Exploratory Music. After months of rehearsals the ensemble pulled off an amazing concert,
            with really effective lighting and choreography between the pieces. The concert consisted
            of pieces by Moya Henderson, Jasmin Leung, Elizabeth Jigalin, and Joseph Franklin as well
            as my piece. Tina Stefanou, the vocalist, did amazing work with costuming and Jane De Bourg
            built set pieces that took this performance from a regular concert to a fully realised
            show. I feel so lucky to have worked with them on this performance and really feel like
            part of the ensemble, not something I get to experience with every collaboration! My piece
            drew an appropriate amount of laughter from the audience, and the instrumentation of theremin,
            voice, toys, music boxes and other instruments seemed to work! Jigalin looked like she had
            suddenly embodied a 1930s thereminist when the concert started, and everyone locked in
            wonderfully to the improvised word prompt page in the middle of the piece, resulting in
            great comedic timing.
            <br><br>
            Video and recording to come soon!

<h3 class="post-title"><strong>MESS Winter Sound School</strong></h3>
<div class="post-content">
      <p>
      This winter I've been spending most of my free time in a cold North Melbourne basement,
      <a href="https://mess.foundation"><strong>Melbourne Electronic Sound Studio</strong></a>. I was
        lucky enough to be accepted into their advanced professional development workshops,
        where I spent 13 weeks playing with vintage electronic instruments including the pictured
        Ondes Martenot, the Korg PS3300, Moog Theremin and the Buchla modular system. It was quite
        a leap out of my comfort zone to go quickly from my basic understanding of synthesis to very
        complex ideas about modular synthesis, MIDI to CV conversion and multi-channel mixing. My
        knowledge in this area has grown in a way that I hardly have time to keep up with - I just
        with I had more time to play around with all the ideas in my head! While taking this course,
        I also fed my new interests by listening to <a href="http://ubu.com/sound/leidecker.html"><strong>
        this broadcast</strong></a> about women in electronic music, and have found myself inspired by
        Daphne Oram, Johanna Beyer and Suzanne Ciani.
        <br><br>
        Some of my music from the course is already up on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jaslynrobertson/korg-ps3300-on-a-windy-afternoon">
        <strong>Soundcloud</strong></a>, with more to come as I get a grip on mixing and mastering
        and plan a Bandcamp release!

         <h3 class="post-title"><strong>MMASS</strong></h3>
         <div class="post-content">
           <p>I spent this week at <a href="http://www.mmass.info/">Music
             Analysis Summer School</a>. Liz Jigalin,
             Jasmin Leung and I held a forum at the end of the week to discuss
             compositional issues with the many talented composers, musicians and analysts attending.
            Here's a paragraph I wrote on the question I posed to the group.
           <br><br>
           Posing the question ‘How do you communicate your sonic desires?’ to this room of diverse musical minds,
            the conversation turned to notation. This topic made quite evident the different approaches composers
            have to control over their music. Most seemed to use standard forms of notation, notes on paper with
            perhaps some graphics or text, handed out to musicians. We didn’t delve too much into the transfer of
            ideas from the score to realisation by musicians, but focused more on how our ‘sonic desires’ move from
            our heads to the page. Many in the room agreed that what’s harder than communicating desires is asking
            oneself, “What do I want in the first place?” Through the conversation, we found that it’s unavoidable
            for notation to become part of the compositional process. Before any sort of sketching of ideas, a
            realm of possibilities exist, and it’s only by putting pen to paper that we start to narrow down these
            options. As one young composer pointed out, this requires giving up your dreams of creating your
            ‘musical masterpiece’, as going from the initial idea state to something more concrete immediately
            opens your work up to limitations. The best advice I heard, though, was to be conscious of how much
            control you actually want over your music. The music of Julio Estrada, who we studied earlier in the week
            in a lecture by Pedro Alvarez, used to be portrayed through heavily detailed scores. In recent years, he’s
            communicated his music through talking directly to performers, abandoning traditional forms of notation
            entirely. What we finished the conversation on this topic with was a bold statement - that choices of
            notation are political. Composers need to be aware of the implications of their notation and make a stance.
