          <p><br>Jaslyn Robertson is a Brisbane born, Melbourne based composer.
            Exploring new sounds and textural possibilities attracts her to the
            use of electronic processing, extended techniques and alternate
            tuning systems. Jaslyn completed a Bachelor of Music – Composition
            at Monash University, where she took lessons with David Chisholm,
            Mary Finsterer and Myles Mumford. She has also attended workshops
            with Liza Lim and Chris Dench. She has composed for world-class
            performers including the Swiss ensemble Vortex, Tristram Williams
            of ELISION, the Argonaut String Quartet and Landesjugendensemble
            Neue Musik Berlin. Her work has received multiple performances in
            Germany, including at the Deutsche Oper as part of Klangwerkstatt
            Festival für Neue Musik Berlin, as well as in Italy. <br>Locally, she
            has had works performed at Tilde New Music Festival, the Bendigo
            International Festival for Exploratory Music and Future Creatives
            Festival, which she runs with a collective of students. Her work
            ‘Wandering’ for quartertone flugelhorn was awarded the 2015 Monash
            University Composition Prize. Inspired by the local music scene she
            has also reviewed performances of new works, which have been
            published in RealTime Arts magazine and on the Partial Durations
            new music blog. Currently, Jaslyn contributes to CutCommon magazine,
            presenting the Queer and Now interview series.
