          <p><br>Jaslyn Robertson is an emerging composer based in Melbourne. An excitement for unusual sounds,
           alternate tuning systems and new forms of notation draws her to interesting instruments including theremin,
           quartertone flugelhorn and analogue synths. At Monash University she studied with David Chisholm and Thomas Reiner,
           and was awarded the prize for best Honours in Music for her composition folio and research on alternate gazes in
           the music of gender oppressed people. She has composed for world-class performers including Tristram Williams,
           the Argonaut String Quartet and Landesjugendensemble Neue Musik Berlin. Her work has received multiple performances
           in Germany, including at the Deutsche Oper as part of Klangwerkstatt Festival f√ºr Neue Musik Berlin, as well as in
           Canada at the Toronto Creative Music Lab. Locally, she has had works performed at Tilde New Music Festival, the
           Bendigo International Festival for Exploratory Music and Future Creatives Festival, which she ran with a collective
           of students. Her work Wandering for quartertone flugelhorn was awarded the 2015 Monash University Composition Prize.
           In 2019, Jaslyn focused on developing her electronic music skills taking an advanced professional development workshop
           over 3 months at Melbourne Electronic Sound Studio. The music box project from Sydney premiered her piece Shallow
           Listening at BIFEM 2019.
